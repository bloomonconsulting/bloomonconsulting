                    <p>My approach to operations is human-centered, understanding that everyone has a different level of comfort with technology, learns differently, and has different business needs. I am a social worker with a decade of experience in community-based nonprofits, so my work has been and always will be people-first.</p>
                    <p>There is no "one-size-fits-all" solution. My goal is to get to know you, your team (if you have one), and how you work best. From there, I will create workflows that actually work for you, make sure you know how to use it, and help you get back to focusing on what's most important: <strong>your clients.</strong></p>
                    <p>Throughout my career, I have always instinctively looked for more innovative ways of doing the work and using technology to it's maximum capabality to do so. I found ways to increase productivity using simple, smart technology.</p>
