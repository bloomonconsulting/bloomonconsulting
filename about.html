          <h2>Merging Internal Operations with External Growth.</h2>

          <p>
            My name is Malak Baker. I am an operations and business development consultant helping service providers build businesses that are as organized internally as they are connected externally.
          </p>

          <p>
            I believe that a successful business requires two things: a stable internal foundation and strong external relationships. Many business owners try to solve these problems separately, hiring admin support to fix the chaos or marketing help to drive sales. But these two areas are deeply connected.
          </p>

          <p>
            I bridge that gap. I help you build the "machine" that runs your business—the software, billing, and workflows—while actively helping you build the network that fuels it through local partnerships and community events.
          </p>

          <p>
            My background shapes this approach. With over a decade of experience in youth-serving nonprofits and a master’s degree as a licensed macro social worker, I understand systems from a human perspective. I approach operations with an ethic of care, ensuring your business is not just efficient, but sustainable for you as a person.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Whether you are a therapist, coach, consultant, or creative, my goal is the same: to give you the structure and connections you need to focus on your craft, not your admin.
          </p>
