                    <div class="case-study-content">
                        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                        <p>A therapist was managing her entire practice manually—appointments were written in a physical calendar, client information was stored in paper files, and reminders were sent via phone calls. This system was:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time-consuming (2-3 hours per day on administrative tasks)</li>
                            <li>Error-prone (double bookings, missed appointments)</li>
                            <li>Limiting growth (couldn't expand due to manual limitations)</li>
                            <li>Frustrating for clients (difficult to schedule, no online options)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The Solution</h4>
                        <p>We implemented a comprehensive calendar and appointment management system that included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Online booking portal available 24/7</li>
                            <li>Automated email and SMS reminders</li>
                            <li>Client database with secure information storage</li>

                            <li>Calendar synchronization across devices</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The Results</h4>
                        <ul class="results-list">
                            <li><strong>60% reduction</strong> in time spent on administrative tasks</li>
