                    <p>My approach to operations comes from a human lens, not a tech manual. I am a social worker with a decade of experience in community-based nonprofits, so I've lived in high-stakes environments where resources are tight. I know that <strong>less money means less people, but it doesn't have to mean less efficiency.</strong></p>
                    <p>At every organization I’ve had the pleasure to be at, I found ways to increase productivity using simple, smart technology. I taught my colleagues these same systems and saw firsthand what happens when people are given the freedom to focus on their real work.</p>
                    <p>Every organization looks and functions differently. There is no "one-size-fits-all" solution. My goal is to get to know you, your team (if you have one), and how you work best. From there, I will create workflows that actually work for you, make sure you know how to use it, and help you get back to focusing on what's most important: <strong>your clients.</strong></p>
