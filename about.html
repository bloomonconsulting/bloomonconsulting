          <h2>Who You'll Be Working With</h2>

          <p>
            My name is Malak Baker. I am an operations and business development consultant helping small business owners and individual service providers build businesses that are organized internally and connected externally.
          </p>

          <p>
            We work as partners. You provide the expertise on your business and your vision. I synthesize your needs and your unique way of working. Together we find the right technology, partnerships, and processes to support your goals.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I am obsessed with efficiency. I find joy in removing the tedious parts of business ownership through creative technology solutions. I adapt quickly. I rapidly learn new platforms and I commit to understanding exactly how you, your business, and your partnerships function.
          </p>

          <p>
            I keep your budget in mind when selecting software and tools. A small budget is okay. I have innovative ways of replicating processes for low or no cost. I can write these solutions directly into your systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            My background shapes this approach. With over a decade of experience in youth-serving nonprofits and a master’s degree as a licensed macro social worker, I understand systems from a human perspective. I approach operations with an ethic of care. This ensures your business is efficient and sustainable for you as a person.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I work with therapists, coaches, consultants, retail businesses, and creatives. My goal is simple. I want to give you the structure and connections you need to focus on your craft.
          </p>
