                    <p>My approach to operations comes from a human lens, not a tech manual. With a decade of experience working directly in community-based nonprofits, I've lived in high-stakes, low-resource environments. I know what it’s like to be stretched thin. I understand that less money means less people, but I firmly believe <strong>it does not have to mean less efficiency.</strong></p>
                    <p>At every organization I had the pleasure to be at, I found ways to increase productivity using simple, smart technology. I taught my colleagues these same systems, and I saw firsthand what happens when passionate people are given the freedom to focus on their real work.</p>
                    <p>This experience means that I actually get it. Every organization looks different and functions differently. There is no "one-size-fits-all" solution. My goal is to get to know you, your team (if you have one), and how you work best. From there, we will create a customized solution, I will make sure you know how to use it, and I will help you get back to focusing on what's most important: <strong>your clients.</strong></p>
